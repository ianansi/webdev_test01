    <p>If you are like me and you love books, you can find a lot of books <a href="https://www.pdfdrive.com"><em><strong>here.</strong></em></a>   You might
    want to listen to a motivational speech in youtube in this <em><strong><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oi4sqDJ8Wno">link</a></strong></em>. <br>
    For if people wish to believe a thing, and long for it and depend on it, and feel better for it, is it cheating to help them to their own belief...
    Is it not rather a charity, and a human kindness? </p>

    <p><em>-from the Author Shankar Vedantham</em></p>
    <p>In the winter of 2011, my wife, my daughter and I set out on a road trip from Washington, DC,
    to Toronto to visit some close friends. It was a beautiful drive that took us through a lushful foothills of
    <strong>Allegheny Mountain Range</strong>
    </p>


    <p>The detour didn't surprise my family too much.  We had made the drive before, and had stopped
        at a maximum security prison so I can interview a man convicted of murder for my book 
        <em><strong>The Hidden Brain</strong></em>.  The meeting was merely with a white-collar criminal.  His old
        U.S. Mrshall-issued "WANTED" posted noted that he was the founder of the cult-type organization
        called <em><b>Church of Love</b></em>
